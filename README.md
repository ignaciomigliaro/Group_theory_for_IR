# Group_theory_for_IR
A notebook to facilitate the teaching of the use of Group theory and symmetry to predict IR bands. 


This notebook is meant to be used in Google Colaboratory in order to make the barrier of entry the smallest possible. The idea behind is to learn the underlying mathematics of group theory and how they can be applied in Chemistry to learn if IR bands will be visible in the spectrum.

The notebook is self contained within the Colabotory and Github repo, Google drives contains the cartesian coordinates of the molecules, and the charactertable.xlsx contains the character tables of all the space groups from which the notebook interacts with through Panda to obtain their symmetries.
