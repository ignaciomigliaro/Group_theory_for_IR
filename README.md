# Group_theory_for_IR
Welcome to this notebook, where we'll be exploring the fascinating world of infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy! These analytical techniques allow us to probe the vibrations of molecules, giving us valuable information about their structure and properties. In this notebook, we'll be using the powerful framework of group theory to predict the IR and Raman bands of molecules. Group theory provides a systematic way of analyzing the symmetries and vibrations of molecules, helping us to understand the different types of vibrational modes and their corresponding spectral features. So, get ready to delve into the exciting world of molecular vibrations and spectroscopy, and let's use group theory to unlock the secrets of IR and Raman spectra!


This notebook is meant to be used in Google Colaboratory in order to make the barrier of entry the smallest possible. The idea behind is to learn the underlying mathematics of group theory and how they can be applied in Chemistry to learn if IR bands will be visible in the spectrum.

The notebook is self contained within the Colabotory and Github repo, Google drives contains the cartesian coordinates of the molecules, and the charactertable.xlsx contains the character tables of all the space groups from which the notebook interacts with through Panda to obtain their symmetries.
